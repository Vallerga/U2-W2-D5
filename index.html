          <h4>
            There are many ideas surrounding personal development, one of which is Abraham Maslow's process of
            self-actualisation.
          </h4>

          <h5>Self-Actualisation</h5>
          <p>
            Maslow (1970) suggests that all individuals have an in-built need for personal development which occurs
            through a process called self-actualisation. The extent to which people are able to develop depends on
            certain needs being met and these needs form a hierarchy. Only when one level of need is satisfied can a
            higher one be developed. As change occurs throughout life, however, the level of need motivating someone’s
            behaviour at any one time will also change. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Physiological Needs, Safety Needs,
            Love and Belongingness, Esteem Needs, Cognitive Needs, Aesthetic Needs and Self-Actualisation.

        </div>
        <div class="col col 3 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between">
          <p class="text-center">
            At the bottom of the hierarchy are the basic physiological needs for food, drink, sex and sleep, i.e., the
            basics for survival. Second are the needs for safety and security in both the physical and economic sense.
            Thirdly, progression can be made to satisfying the need for love and belonging. The fourth level refers to
            meeting the need for self-esteem and self-worth. This is the level most closely related to
            ‘self-empowerment’. The fifth level relates to the need to understand. This level includes more abstract
            ideas such as curiosity and the search for meaning or purpose and a deeper understanding. The sixth relates
            to aesthetic needs of beauty, symmetry and order. Finally, at the top of Maslow’s hierarchy is the need for
            self-actualisation. Maslow (1970, p.383) says that all individuals have the need to see themselves as
            competent and autonomous, also that every person has limitless room for growth. Self-actualisation refers to
            the desire that everybody has ‘to become everything that they are capable of becoming’. In other words, it
            refers to self-fulfilment and the need to reach full potential as a unique human being. For Maslow, the path
            to self-actualisation involves being in touch with your feelings, experiencing life fully and with total
            concentration. Maslow, A. H. (1970), Motivation and Personality, (2nd Edition), Harper & Row, New York. For
